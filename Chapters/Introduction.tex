    \section{Tooling}
    In this thesis i will use many tools such as: 
       \begin{itemize}
        \item[$\bullet$] pwndbg : pwndbg is a GDB plugin that makes debugging with GDB with a focus on features needed by low-level software developers, hardware hackers, reverse engineers, and developer exploitation.\newline
        \item[$\bullet$]pwntools: is a very powerful Python library created to make difficult things easy in exploit development.\newline
        Such as receiving program output contents, sending user input, sending bytes instead of letters, and much more.\newline
        \item[$\bullet$] ghidra or ida free: 
        ghidra is a free tool developed by the NSA used to decompile binary files.
        ida free is the free version of ida pro and is a cloud base decompiler, the free version works only for some architecture such as x8664.\newline
        both tools are used in the reverse engineering part.\newline
    \end{itemize}
